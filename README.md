Hi, welcome to Version 2.0 of my website. I build this as a method of testing my recently aquired knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Over the next few weeks I will be improving and refining the formatting of this website. Future changes include:
<ul>
  <li>Adding a back to top button that appears on all sections of the website</li>
</ul>
